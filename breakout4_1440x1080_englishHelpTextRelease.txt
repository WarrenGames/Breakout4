This release concerns the Breakout4 with 1440x1080 pixels windows resolutions only.

Details on the precompiled binaries of the breakout4 game. There are explanations about compiling sources by yourself just below.

The binaries have been compiled with Mingw64 compiler which you can download at this address: https://www.winlibs.com

These Breakout4 binaries are made to be played ideally in full screen if you have an HD screen,
but you can choose between a windows or full screen game, just carefully read the introduction screen, that tells
you which key to press to switch to windowed or full screen mode.

Playing the game by compiling the sources by yourself is rather simple:
- Download the sources with the zip format (ideally for windows users) or tar.gz (for linux users) by clicking
	on 'Source code' in the release screen.
- Unzip the archive in a directory of your choice and read carefully the file in the top directory named
	'compileSourcesHowTo.txt'. In particular, you should set the cmake command line value 'SQUARE_SIZE' to 72 for 
        the x72 textures i.e. the 1440x1080 game resolution.
- Once the binaries are compiled, download 'breakout4_textures_x72_for1440.7z' then if you are under windows:
	'dataWindowsEndline_crlf.7z' or 'dataUnixEndline_linefeed.7z' instead if you want to play the game under linux.
	Download the file 'fontsAndSounds.7z' too.

- Choice a directory for the final game/application (named 'AppDir' next to make things simple).
- Copy the compiled binaries to AppDir.
- Unzip 'breakout4_textures_x72_for1440_vX.X.X.7z' in AppDir.
- Unzip 'fontsAndSounds_vX.X.X.7z' in AppDir.
- Unzip 'dataWindowsEndline_crlf_vX.X.X.7z' or 'dataUnixEndLine_linefeed_vX.X.X.7z' in AppDir.

- If everything went fine you'd have the following directory tree in AppDir

AppDir
	|-data
	|-fonts
	|-licenses
	|-musics
	|-sounds
	|-textures
	
- Then run 'breakout4_game' or 'breakout4_game.exe' to play the game. If you want to use an icon to run the game, don't forget to indicate 'AppDir' as a working directory for the game.
