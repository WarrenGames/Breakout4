2024-08-30 : The main CMakeLists.txt file has been modified. There was a bug with the executables names 'breakout4_game', 
	'breakout4_levelEditor' and breakout4_savesEditor' which led to an error when invoking cmake.

2024-07-20 : The main CMakeLists.txt file has been modified, the line 8 doesn't contain the word 'BOOL' anymore, which led to a bug when
	the 'USE_WX_WIDGETS_FRAMEWORK' value was set to OFF, cmake even searched the wxWidgets framework whereas the user of the 
	libraries explicitly tell cmake to not search/use it in the configuration/compilation process.

2024-05-01 : new CMakeLists.txt file that makes the wxWidgets framework optional/not mandatory any longer (but with some restrictions, like 
	not building wxSavesEditor or wxLevelEditor executables). The game executable don't need wxWidgets.

2024-02-08 : many saves editor bug fixes.
