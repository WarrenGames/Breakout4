2024-10-15 :
	- Several bug in breakout4_levelEditor have been fixed (the toolbar buttons in particular when browsing game bricks). 
	- Some structs or class declared consts (with a move constructor or a move assignation) don't have the const keyword 
		anymore (this might cause several warning in the future in case of move and is quite useless excepted if you are a const 
		correctness addict ;-) ). 
	- The demo recording feature, records the sound when the ball bounce against the racket, so that playing a demo restitute the 
	sound while playing it. 
	- When recording a demo the brick layout at level starting is recorded inside the demo file, so when the grid file has been 
		deleted in the past, that doesn't matter anymore.
	- The following lines have been added in all sub 'CMakeLists.txt' files to keep directories tree structure in generated project files 
		(Visual Studio solution files for example, useless in Makefile projects):
		----CMakeLists.txt----
		source_group( TREE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}
		FILES ${HEADERS} ${SOURCES}
		)
		----------------------

2024-08-30 : The main CMakeLists.txt file has been modified. There was a bug with the executables names 'breakout4_game', 
	'breakout4_levelEditor' and breakout4_savesEditor' which led to an error when invoking cmake.

2024-07-20 : The main CMakeLists.txt file has been modified, the line 8 doesn't contain the word 'BOOL' anymore, which led to a bug when
	the 'USE_WX_WIDGETS_FRAMEWORK' value was set to OFF, cmake even searched the wxWidgets framework whereas the user of the 
	libraries explicitly tell cmake to not search/use it in the configuration/compilation process.

2024-05-01 : new CMakeLists.txt file that makes the wxWidgets framework optional/not mandatory any longer (but with some restrictions, like 
	not building wxSavesEditor or wxLevelEditor executables). The game executable don't need wxWidgets.

2024-02-08 : many saves editor bug fixes.
